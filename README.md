# ergotype

A touch typing trainer designed to encourage optimal fingerings. 

## Ideas

- Typing accuracy inevitably leads to typing speed. 
- Optimal finger to press a key is dependent on the situation.
- Four consecutive four keys in a row of a keyboard are a homerow (e.g. `uiop` and  `iop[` on qwerty).
- Homerows can easily be reached and typed (small movements of the wrist are helpful).
- Single hand exercises are useful (not exclusively, of course).

## TODOs:

- Improve exercises and their order.
- Add exercises with dictionary words.
- Add exercises for speed.
- Make more portable and describe build process.
- Enable different languages and keyboard layouts.
- Get rid of hard-coded stuff in code.
- Clean up code.
